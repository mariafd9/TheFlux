          <center>
          <p>Chicago is the city that works. It has always run on unions. But with neighboring states adopting new legislation that allows workers to opt out of union membership, and Illinois’ new governor looking to follow suit, unions are facing their biggest political threat yet.</p>
          <p class="profile-intro">Union membership in Illinois has declined steadily in recent years. Only 15 percent of Illinois workers were members of a union in 2014, compared with 36 percent in 1964, according to The Center for Union Facts. The state faces a $6 billion budget deficit and a pension crisis that could prevent hundreds of thousands of government employees from retiring. Governor Bruce Rauner hopes to fix the state’s finances with his “turnaround plan,” which includes right-to-work legislation that could affect how unions negotiate with their employers.</p>

        <p class="profile-intro">Though recent attempts to implement a right-to-work law in Illinois have been repelled by labor lobbyists and their allies, the dwindling numbers and cultural cache of organized labor in general has taken its toll. The struggle over a unionized workforce is at a crossroads. Some question the purpose of unions, and say they must adapt to the brave new world of globalized labor and economics. Others say unions are key to a vibrant middle class and are more important than ever as the wealth gap grows wider and wider. There is no doubt that the face of organized labor will change; it’s just a matter of how.</p>

    <p>Chicago’s public school teachers may soon be taking cues from the past.</p>
    <p>In 2012, Chicago’s public school teachers went on strike in response to a series of procedural changes issued by the city Board of Education, including a longer school day and a teacher evaluation system that prioritized students’ standardized test scores. Three years later, on the verge of their next contract negotiation, the teachers’ union and the Board of Ed. are once again at an impasse.</p>
    <p>The Chicago Teacher’s Union, which represented more than 27,000 teachers in 2014, serves as a microcosm for a much larger struggle between Illinois’ municipalities and its employees. The state’s budget deficit, six billion dollars and growing, stems in large part from its responsibility to pay retiring employees’ pensions plans. Though those pensions were protected by the Illinois Supreme Court, benefits, wagees and legal representation have long been the responsibility of the CTU. Though unionized employment in the state has held steady at 15 percent for years, more than 50 percent of public employees have organized representation.</p>
    <p>To Curtis Bynum, a CTU organizer, the teacher’s union exists not only to raise awareness of the debates surrounding education but also to help teachers who find themselves overworked and overwhelmed.</p>

    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>“[The] CTU’s position is, look, let’s take this burden [of contract negotiation] off the classroom teacher,” Bynum said. “You get in there and you do your job and do the best you can with what you have, and let us fight this battle of getting you a fair and just contract and equity in the system. You should have teachers walking into a professional environment on a daily basis, being respected.”</p>

    <p>In 2015, the fight is centered on salaries. After refusing to extend their 2012 contract, the city has asked teachers to accept a 7 percent pay cut. For the city, paying teachers more would expand a budget deficit they’re working to close. For the teachers, accepting a reduction in funding would be considered a blow to the members who fought against the reforms three years ago. Plus, the union exists specifically to make sure teachers are paid and supported as well as the city will allow. With the June 30 contract negotiation deadline fast approaching, both organizations are refusing to back down.</p>
    <p>Bynum believes their members are prepared to do whatever is necessary to protect the progress they’ve made in recent years. He predicted that teachers, already wary of school administrators in the wake of a fight still fresh in their mind, would not hesitate to participate again if a peaceful resolution cannot be reached in time.</p>
    <p>Three years ago, retired teacher Pat Knazze stood on the picket lines alongside working Chicago teachers. Knazze has been an active member of the CTU since she first started teaching in 1972 and now serves as co-chair of the Retired Teachers Committee. If teachers decide to strike again, she said she would not hesitate to support her “brothers and sisters” should they choose to walk out.</p>

    <p>“The only thing that a worker has is to withhold your labor,” Knazze said. “That’s all you have. You have to withhold your labor in order for your employer to understand that we need to negotiate in good faith and we can’t balance the budget on our backs.”</p>
    <p>Some teachers see the strike as inevitable. Carrie Seavoy, a first-year teacher at Gwendolyn Brooks Preparatory Academy, prioritizes the effect it would have on her students over classroom improvements.</p>

    <p>“What’s worse,” she said, “having a school district with a little less money or not being in school for two weeks because the teachers are walking around outside?”</p>
    <p>Strikes require teachers to show up to work but ban them from entering their classrooms. Seavoy sees both the pros and cons of the strike. Although she believes the lack of instruction would hurt students, she acknowledged that much of the union’s platform reflects changes she wants to see in her own classroom. </p>
    <p>Bynum, who taught in CPS from 2003 until joining the CTU staff this past February, said current teachers are increasingly overworked. Early in his career, he had time to focus on training and research that he could bring into the classroom. Teachers, now bombarded with paperwork and city-mandated procedures, have no time or incentive to cultivate a personalized classroom experience.</p>
    <p>Seavoy attests to this when she described the daily protocol used at her school. She said the school districts and individual principals require large amounts of paperwork and documentation, taking away time from the classroom. </p>
    <p>Sending an email home to parents commending their student’s hard work or improvement no longer sits at the click of a button. In addition, she has to document the email on two different websites. As the music and theatre teacher, planning a concert requires Seavoy to submit details through three separate online approval systems. In order to sell concert tickets, she must fill out four sheets of paperwork.</p>
    <p>“Teaching is truly the busiest job in the world,” Seavoy said. “And being in CPS, there’s just all of this additional paperwork that we have to do on top of everything else.”</p>
    <p><div class="displaytext">“The teaching part will always be great,” she added. “But all of this other stuff is why people don’t want to be teachers anymore.”</div></p>
    <p>Because she’s only in her first year, Seavoy hasn’t experienced much change at her school. However, she’s aware of the union’s ongoing fight and knows that teachers will go on strike if the Board and the union don’t negotiate a new contract.</p>
    <p>Seavoy also explained that her class size &mdash;one already at a whopping 46 students&mdash; are expected to grow next year. She wonders how effective she’ll be able to be in the classroom.</p>
    <p>Regardless of whether or not Chicago’s teachers walk out over a new contract dispute, Bynum said tensions between between Chicago’s teachers and their employers will remain high.</p>
    <p>“The buck doesn’t stop there,” he said. “You have to continue to fight. You’re not going to roll over and say, ‘that’s the end, we’re done.’ Ultimately, you’re going to have some impact in making change and so whatever Rauner and the school board does, you still fight. There may be some untapped glimmer of hope out there and so, we will continue to push on.”</p>

    <h1>A Modernization</h1>
    <hr style="height:8px;border:2px;" class="dek-dash"/>
    <center>
      <p class="lead">Michael Lucci was a grocery store employee as a teenager. His experiences there helped shape his belief in and advocacy for right-to-work.</p>
    </center>
  </div>
   <div class="col-md-1"></div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3"></div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>When Michael Lucci started working as a cashier at Santisi’s IGA grocery store in Youngstown, Ohio, as a teenager, he had no idea it would spark questions that would eventually lead him to a career in labor policy.</p>
    <p>Lucci had to pay dues to keep his job because Santisi’s union contract required their employees to join.</p>
    <p>Lucci said his union dues cut his paycheck significantly. While he wasn’t trying to put food on the table as a teenager, he thought it didn’t seem fair. Why would he unwillingly pay large part of his take-home pay, just to keep his minimum wage job? He said he asked the owner of Santisi’s if he could stop paying his union dues.</p>
    <p>The response, he said, was adamant: “When I stop paying the union, that’s when you can stop paying the union.”</p>
    <p>Today, Lucci works as the director of jobs and growth at the Illinois Policy Institute, a nonprofit that researches and develops public policy solutions. The Institute’s pro-business policies and connection to the Rauner campaign has earned it a reputation as a conservative think tank.</p>
    <p>At the Institute, Lucci works on developing policies he said will help grow the Illinois economy by making the state a place where entrepreneurs and businesses can succeed.</p>
    <p>As a kid, Lucci remembers when steel mills used to be one of the largest manufacturers in Youngstown.</p>
    <p>In 1977, Youngstown and other major steel cities like Pittsburgh were hit hard by Black Monday, when a large steel manufacturer, Youngstown Sheet and Tube, shut its doors.</p>
    <div class="displaytext"><p>“It essentially wiped out the middle class,” said Lucci.</p></div>
    <p>Since Black Monday, Youngstown has lost over half of its population and has struggled to recover.</p>
    <p>Growing up in a steel industry town burdened by globalization and trying to adjust has led him to believe that the Illinois Turnaround plan will put Illinois back on its feet.</p>
    <p>Lucci looks to labor statistics in Indiana as a sign that right-to-work could spur Illinois’ job growth.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-2"></div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <blockquote>
      <p>Unions can force you to pay money for you to just have a job. It's allowing for individual choice.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>Right-to-work has increased union membership in Indiana, where overall union membership is up to 10.8% in 2014, an increase from 9.2% in 2012, when right-to-work was enacted, according to The Center for Union Facts.</p>
    <p>In Indiana the number of manufacturing jobs has also increased. In fact, Lucci said, Indiana has increased their total manufacturing jobs by 7.7 percent while Illinois has decreased by .6 percent.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3"></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3"></div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>While Indiana has added manufacturing jobs, union workers are still making $54 more a week than non-union manufacturing workers nationwide as of 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Stephanie Seawell, executive director of the Illinois Labor History Society, said there is a correlation between strong union representation and higher wages across the board for both workers in and out of unions inside that line of work. “A rising tide lifts all boats,” Seawell said.</p>
    <p>However, Lucci pointed out that Illinois is having the hardest time recovering from the recession.</p>
    <p>“What we have in Illinois is a broken status quo,” he said.</p>
    <p>Lucci sees a connection between Illinois’ financial problems and lack of job growth. On the Illinois Policy Institute’s blog, he frequently cites the lower property taxes and right-to-work laws of Illinois’ neighbors as causes for the state’s stagnant population growth. According to U.S. Census data, llinois population shrank by 9,972 people between 2013-2014.</p>
    <p>In Lucci’s mind, any successful plan to fixing Illinois financial problems will include new legislation that helps businesses grow, including incentives to bring new businesses, and new jobs, into the state. Giving workers the option to opt out of a union, is just one of many things Illinois can do to bring in workers.</p>
    <p>Although he didn’t fully understand all of the politics then, but in retrospect Lucci thinks right-to-work could have helped him at Santisi’s.</p>
    <p>“Unions can force you to pay money for you to just have a job,” Lucci said. “It’s allowing for individual choice... It's a modernization.”</p>

    <p>The buses were arranged by the Workers Organizing Committee of Chicago, an advocacy group for fast food workers that runs the Chicago chapter of “Fight for 15,” a national movement to raise the minimum wage. The protesters knew what they wanted: a base-wage bump to $15 per hour, and the right for McDonald’s employees to unionize. In Oak Brook, they would stand close enough to the company to make sure someone would hear.</p>
    <p>The 40 or so riders included four organizers, a handful of concerned citizens and pockets of students from labor groups at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Harold Washington College. Though no one fretted over the weather, many came prepared, with raincoats or umbrellas, and backpacks with extra food and water. The group rode in relative quiet, eating their WOCC-provided sandwiches and chatting among themselves on the way to the protest.</p>
    <p>They planned to meet up with Fight for 15 advocates from across the country, some from as far away as Atlanta and New York, for a half-mile march from a nearby office park to McDonald’s corporate campus. A stage erected on McDonald’s Drive served as the focal point of the protest, allowing speakers to address the crowd.</p>
    <p>The movement had high hopes for this particular protest. Organizers expected more than 5,000 people, making it their largest single-stage gathering to date.</p>
    <p>The sheer numbers, however, did not quite meet their expectations. Police reported that about 2,000 protesters marched that day. Still, the program was massive compared to the group’s protest during the same week last year, when 500 protesters blocked traffic on McDonald’s’ campus.</p>
    <p>Shortly after the bus departed the WOCC offices, Christina Rivero, an organizer for WOCC, went over the plan and introduced the group’s heavy hitter, Tyree Johnson, 46, who has worked at McDonald’s for half of his life. As a veteran of 10 strikes, Johnson has become a de facto poster boy for unionizing fast food workers in Chicago.</p>

    <h3 class="subhead">The Set-up – 11:13 am</h3>
    <p>Everyone got off the bus, joining the stream of red Fight for 15 shirts and black McDonald’s visors around the corner to Hunter Drive, a roughly 450-foot-long road wedged between a few office buildings and 22nd street which served as the staging point for the march. They raised signs and unfurled banners. One group brought a giant cardboard paycheck for $206.17, one week’s pay at minimum wage, signed by Ronald McDonald.</p>

     <p>McDonald’s has taken steps to raise their hourly pay in 2015. In April, the company announced plans to raise its starting salary to a dollar higher than each location’s local minimum wage. This would apply to stores owned and operated by the company, about 10 percent of its U.S. locations. Most McDonald's locations are owned by independent franchises.</p>
    <p>Down the parade line, various calls and responses would drift in and out of earshot. “What do we want?” Someone would call. ”15!” A group would respond. “When do we want it?” The call.  “Now!,” The response.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t get it?”</p>
    <p>“Shut it down!”</p>
    <p>“If we don’t get it?”</p>
    <p>“Shut it down!”</p>
    <p>The crowd kept calm as protesters filled the street- when they were asked keep off the grass in front of the offices along the block, they stepped back onto the street. During the Fight for 15 protest at Oak Brook last year, more than 130 Fight for 15 activists allowed themselves to be arrested for trespassing at McDonald’s nearby offices.</p>
    <p>A couple of men on the roof of a building overlooking the street watched the spectacle, but very few people other than the organizers seemed concerned with their presence.</p>

    <h3 class="subhead">The March – 11:30 am</h3>
    <p>Once most of the protesters reached their starting positions, the group jerked forward, beginning the march towards McDonald’s headquarters. Police blocked westbound traffic, lining the road with bicycle-bound officers to keep meandering protesters from wandering onto the street or spilling onto pedestrian walkways. The Oak Brook police department gathered 300 officers from 100 agencies across the state to ensure they could cover the whole route for the duration of the protest.</p>

    <p>“Fired up! We can’t it take no more!,” the bellow of the crowd travelled down the march as one group handed off their chant to the next. “We’re fired up! Can’t take it no more!”</p>
    <p>They had every to reason to get excited: Since Fight for 15 last appeared in Oak Brook, there have been major victories for activists lobbying to raise the minimum wage. In December 2014, Chicago’s city council voted to raise the minimum wage from $8.25 to $10 effective July 1, 2015, and up to $13 in 2019. Just the day before the protest, Los Angeles voted to raise the city’s minimum wage to $15 by 2020.</p>

    <p>Even when the decibel level was high, the pace kept to a casual stroll. Women pushed strollers. Friends conversed. Some posed for pictures or lifted their phones above the crowd.</p>
    <p>Underneath the call and response flowed an undercurrent of concern. Many of the protesters didn’t see the Los Angeles minimum wage increase as a victory. Some were hopeful that it might start a wider trend, but many lamented that those living in poverty would still have make to it through five more years of anemic wages.</p>
    <p>“If it weren’t for my girls working,” said Yolanda Wright, a 38-year-old McDonald’s employee, “we’d be in bad [shape], for real.” Wright and her two daughters, Tameika, 22, and Romeka Williams, 21, all work at McDonald’s.</p>

    <h3 class="subhead">The Stage – 12:20 pm</h3>
    <p>When the front of the march reached the stage, the program began. Protesters put down their signs. The people were ready to listen.</p>
    <p>One by one, a series of McDonald’s workers told the group about their economic struggles. The crowd listened intently, cheering or responding.  Many were unable to support their families: Two women, Kwanza Brooks and Keandra Guilmant, brought their children with them on stage.</p>
    <p>“Every month I try to figure out how to pay my bills,” Guilmant said, holding back tears. “And it’s hard.”</p>
    <p>Reverend Rodney Williams, chairperson of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People religious affairs committee, and Reverend William Barber II, president of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP, headlined the program.</p>
    <p>Rev. Barber emphasized the need for fast food workers to unionize.</p>
    <div class="displaytext"><p>“You are not looking for a hand-out,” he said. “You are fighting for a living wage, and that’s as American as apple pie.”</p></div>

</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3"></div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h3 class="subhead">The Bus Home – 2:00 pm</h3>
    <p>After the speeches, the crowd dispersed, retreating to buses parked along the road and in nearby parking lots.</p>
    <p>Back on bus 010, the group was chattier and friendlier, bonded by a day of fighting what they saw as the good fight.</p>
    <p>Rivero told group the agenda for day two: protesters would meet back in Oak Brook at 6am, present a million-signature petition —gathered by Fight for 15 outfits from across the country— to McDonald’s before the shareholders’ meeting, and protest again outside their headquarters. Unlike the first day, however, there would be no ride from downtown. No lunch would be provided.</p>
    <p>The response was supportive, but the group had clearly given as much energy as it could muster. Tyree Johnson quickly fell asleep lying across the back row of the bus. Patricia Knazze, a retired teacher, mentioned that the teachers’ union would be in Springfield the next day at their own protest, though she would not be attending it herself. The Harold Washington College students chatted about their spring semester grades.</p>
    <p>The next day would bring a second wave of roughly 1,000 protesters returning to Oak Brook, about half the size of the initial march.</p>

    <p>Every Mayday, Hale Landes communes with his fellow workers at Haymarket Square on N. Desplaines St., where Chicago’s labor movement was born. The Chicago Federation of Labor, with Illinois Labor History Society and other groups, holds a small event to celebrate and speak out on behalf of workers.  Landes stood among a small crowd of laborers from various unions and labor rights supporters, holding up a black and red sign, demanding, “Stop the war on workers!”</p>
    <p>“Solidarity forever,” the whole group sang, led by a man with a guitar on the small Mayday rally stage. “For the union makes us strong!”</p>
    <p>Landes thought it was a good day for a rally. Not too hot, not too cold, not too sunny. Whether he’s on the job, or at a rally Landes always wears the same get-up: Blue jeans and a bright orange t-shirt representing his local, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers #134.</p>

    <p>He weaved through the protesters, who were gathered around the stage, and stopped to speak with labor activists he’d either met at other rallies or knew as fellow members of the Illinois Labor History Society. He didn't bring his sign from home; someone put a sign made by another union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, in his hand.</p>
    <p>Mayday, known as the “workers’ holiday,” commemorates a strike and ensuing riot that occurred May 1, 1886. The “Haymarket Affair,” a massive strike by Chicago factory workers demanding an eight-hour work day and child labor reform, ended with the prosecution and sometimes execution of labor activists.</p>

  <div class="col-md-3"></div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Every year, protesters at the Haymarket Mayday rally call for the same thing—the right for laborers across the world to unionize. But in 2015, that demand held special value in Illinois, amid a series of attempts to bring right-to-work legislation to the state.</p>
    <p>Landes’ position on these issues extends beyond opposing Rauner’s plan. He believes in a bottom-up approach to the economy: That any organization or law that puts money in the hands of workers will increase spending and naturally spread the wealth.</p>
    <div class="displaytext"><p>“Mr. Rauner’s ‘turnaround agenda’ is a bunch of hooey,” Landes said.</p></div>
    <p>“It’s not going to help. Getting rid of the unions won’t help… That’s taking money out of the pockets of the real job creators. The people who are spending their money.”</p>
    <p>Landes’ career in electrical maintenance has kept an even keel since he joined International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers almost 30 years ago. Landes found his way to the IBEW through a friend already in the union, who hired him as a security technician trainee, which led to him getting a “Class A” electrician permit. His road would have been longer had he came to the union without any connections.</p>
    <p>For nearly two decades, Landes, 54 has kept the lights on and electricity flowing in O’Hare’s parking facilities, on behalf of his employer, the Gim Electric Company, which has a contract with the airport.</p>
    <p>Landes has seen his local slowly wither over the course of his career. IBEW #134, whose membership includes a large subset of independent electricians working with Chicago contractors, has seen a steady decline in membership, from 17,807 members in 2008, to 12,610 in 2013. There’s little hope for an influx of new blood: The percentage of Illinois’ unionized jobs has hovered around 15 percent from 2004 to 2014.</p>
    <p>Landes’ way of life hasn’t been entirely unaffected by the gradual weakening of the movement.</p>
    <p>“I make a good wage,” Landes said. “That being said, my wages have been pretty stagnant. One year we got no raise at all. Another year we got a fifty-cent raise, which doesn’t keep up with inflation.”</p>
    <p>The rate on Landes paycheck will go up from $44 to $45 per hour on June 1, 2015, as his current IBEW contract enters its third year. His new wages also includes an extra $1.25, which will be applied to supporting union benefits, such as insurance and the union’s apprenticeship program. He described the increase as standard.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I looked around and I had a fear that he had no future, through no fault of his own.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>Landes spent the first 20 years of his career as an active, but not necessarily outspoken, member of the union. That changed when Landes’ first grandson, Gage, was born in 2007. He realized there were forces that might prevent Gage from providing for his family if he were to become a unionized laborer.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3"></div>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>“The reason I became involved is I looked around and I had a fear that he had no future,” Landes said, “through no fault of his own.”</p>
    <p>Landes considers his union as a contributing factor to many of his life’s proudest accomplishments —owning a home, putting his wife through college and nursing school and raising his two children.</p>
    <p>Not only does his union contract maintain Landes wage, but also he receives health insurance, multiple pensions and legal representation for work-related matters. To him, any legislation, including any kind of right-to-work law, is a step towards a world where working Americans will not receive similar compensation.</p>
    <p>“If they [big companies] could get us to work for free, they would.”</p>
    <p>Landes wonders why more workers in non-union sectors don’t feel outraged by the general shift in the American job market away from providing the benefits his union ensures, including retirement benefits, such as a pension.</p>
    <p>“I’m very tired of hearing people say, ‘I don’t get a pension. Why should you?’ That’s the wrong thing to say. The question is, ‘I do get a pension. Why don’t you?’”</p>
    <div class="displaytext"><p>“I want to spend time with my grandkids,” Landes added. “I don’t want to drop dead at work.”</p></div>
    <p>And Landes would happily help any worker go out and get those benefits. He takes the idea of worker “brotherhood” very seriously. When he sees a fellow union worker on the job, he greets them, “Hey brother” (or “sister”). He goes out of his way to buy products made in America, at union-friendly shops.</p>
    <p>While visiting family in Kentucky over Memorial Day weekend, Landes heard about a group of United Steelworkers union members who were protesting outside Century Aluminum, a smelting facility in Hawkesville, Kentucky, where contract negotiations prompted the employer to lock the workers out. Landes packed up his stepson and his two grandsons and drove 45 minutes to the factory to join them.</p>
    <p>He said that when he heard about the lockout he felt he “had to go.”</p>
    <p>They didn’t stay long — about 45 minutes, by Landes’ count. It was a Sunday and holiday weekend, so there weren’t many people out, plus the sparsely populated refinery parking lots didn’t make a particularly engaging playground for young boys.</p>
    <p>After they left, the Landes’ clan completed their “boys day out” with a trip to Rural King, a farming supply store, and got some ice cream. Landes didn’t necessarily think his grandsons got much out of the experience at the picket line, but their presence helped the Steelworkers’ cause all the same.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t say they enjoyed it, Landes said of their time at the protest. “But as we were driving off, my son asked them, ‘how did they feel making all those people smile being there?’ And that they liked that. Putting smiles on people’s faces.”</p>
