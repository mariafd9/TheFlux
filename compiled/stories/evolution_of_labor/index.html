							<p class="profile-intro">Although Illinois has always been seen as pro-union territory, its union membership has declined steadily since 1964, dropping from 35.6 to 15.2 percent of employees in 2014. Governor Rauner also faces a $6 billion budget deficit and a pension crisis. He hopes to fix the state’s financial woes with his “turnaround plan,” which includes right-to-work legislation that could affect how unions negotiate with their employers.<p>

										<p>Rafael Marquez sits on a rock in Gomper’s Park near his home in Albany Park. He had just saved up enough to move there a few years ago with his daughters. A small brook flows nearby and he stares into it smiling. He jokes around as we set up our microphone and talks a bit about himself before we begin. Marquez is a chef. His joy and passion lies in cooking for people. In fact, at the time of our interview, he had just gotten back from a special dinner that he cooked. Marquez has been working in 1840 Hinman’s dining hall for the past 11 years. As soon as he entered the workforce, he made sure to join a union. He counts it as an essential part of belonging to the American work force. His smile turns to a grimace when asked about Right to Work.</p>

										<p>“Right to Work is the right to be unemployed,” he says. “If you’re giving another worker the rights to get the same benefits as a worker who is paying dues, the unions suffer. What built this country out of The Great Depression? Unions.”</p>

										<p>Currently he belongs the union UNITE HERE Local 1. Unite here represents some 15,000 hospitality workers in the Chicagoland area and is known for its recent public campaigns and protests for worker’s rights at the Congress Hotel, Chicago Public Schools, Chicago’s airports and Hyatt Hotels.<p>

											<p>A few years ago, Marquez was elected to be a Union Steward for Unite Local One. As a union steward, his duties are to defend the rights of his coworkers and himself within their contract agreements with Sodexo and Northwestern.</p> 

											<p>“As a union rep, I’ve represented people of all ethnicities who spoke languages that were not English- people who definitely would not have been heard otherwise.”
												He has also seen protests during his time at Northwestern as a union representative.</p>

												<p>“Last spring we organized and protested against Sodexo management because they tried to overwork my fellow coworkers instead of hiring more people. As a union steward, I let management know that they they didn’t have the right to point out an overworked employee and that they should have simply replaced the fired worker and they tried to shut my work down. It’s a slave master mentality. One worker cannot do two worker’s jobs! And so they told me to stop talking and that I couldn’t stand up for my worker and I got suspended from the job. And within two days, we organized and protested in a march alongside about fifty students. They think that we’re just machines- no! We’re actually people who interact with students and mean something. I’m a part of this community too. We become a part of the college experience.  Food makes people feel comfortable- especially when you’re so far away from home.”</p>

												<p>Marquez was suspended for a quarter without pay for his outburst when standing up for his coworker and when he came back, his hours were drastically reduced from 37.5 hours a week down to 27.5 hours a week. That difference of 10 hours made him ineligible for health insurance and took a major toll on his finances.</p>

												<p>“They were trying to retaliate against me because I stood up for a worker,” he says shaking his head.</p>

												<p>“I talked to one of my student friends about my suspension and she was shocked. She told me that we’d organize and have a rally. I was thinking two or three students would show up. In two days, I showed up to see 50-60 students waiting for me at the arch."</p>

												<p>He laughed.</p>

												<p>“She told all the students I was cool with and they all came through for me. And that was in two days! Imagine what we could do in a month, a couple months, with a union behind us. Imagine that! There’s a lot of power there. And I think that Northwestern and Sodexo really shiver in their boots when they think about us organizing and bringing attention to worker rights here.</p>

												</blockquote>
											</div>


											<div class="col-md-4">
												<p>Marquez explains the connection between Sodexo and Northwestern and his union like this: “Sodexo is a contractor, and acts as the liaison between Northwestern and the workers. Northwestern already has so much money and agreed with Sodexo this year to raise tuition. For the first year of your time at Northwestern, there’s a meal plan that you have to take. our meal plan is included in the tuition. What I realized as a food service worker for 10 years is that the meal plan is not appealing to students because they are serving heavily processed foods. The students go out to eat instead. Making less food and less quality food on campus diminishes students coming to eat as well as workers hours. Workers are cooking less and they’re making less food. </p> 
											</div>

											<div class="col-md-3"></div>
										</div>


										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-md-3"></div>
											<div class="col-md-6">
												<p>They are slowly diminishing options for students in the dining halls. Because Sodexo has a contract with Northwestern and they’re going to get paid the same, they decided that we cook less, they spend less. This leads to layoffs, cutting of hours- and that’s what’s been happening. I’ve been a victim of that, and so have my coworkers. By offering people cookies and chicken nuggets as dinner,  it turns into “well, you’re not a cook no more.” management could do it themselves- or anybody- even the guy that sweeps the floor could do it! So they start diminishing hours and laying people off“ And I don’t know if Northwestern is turning a blind eye or what.”</p>

												<p>When asked about how his union could help make things better at Northwestern, Marquez immediately answered.</p> 

												<p>“I think we must agree to a living wage at Northwestern University. Northwestern is a very rich University and they make so much money off of just your meal plan, but meanwhile they’re starving the workers and the students!”</p>

												<p>Marquez asserts that his Union provides workers with protection and student involvement. One of the biggest assets that Marquez’s union has provided him with in the past is that they help him as a sole worker to get the word out whenever he or one of his fellow co-workers has been mistreated.</p> 

												<p>“You see that rock over there?”</p>

												<p>Marquez points to a large grey boulder sticking up out of the other side of the brook.</p>

												<p>“Its union is solid! You can’t mess with that rock because it’s got enough weight to protect itself and stay together. Rocks have been around long before we got here and they’ll be here long after. Why would you wanna fuck that up? A de-unionized rock is just a bunch of pebbles. Pebbles get knocked all over the place. A pebble can be lifted by the wind and never seen again.”</p>

												<p>He whistles.</p>

												<p>“But a boulder man, that’s solid. Leave it alone. Messing with unions is messing with a rock that was built and is solid and has historically helped people to overcome poverty. And now they want to go reverse all that progress. But if people don’t fight, they’ll get what’s coming to them. A bunch of pebbles.”</p>

												<p>He goes back to speaking about Right to Work and the impact that it would have on his life as a food service employee.</p>

												<p>“Right to work… it’s like a cancer. They always say “Well, since it’s spreading, I guess we’d better go ahead and catch it now too!” he laughs.</p>

												<p>“I think Right to Work is a crock of shit. I think that the people of Ilinois wanted a lot of different changes, better jobs, cheaper housing, better schools whatever - and any one of those factors could have to do with people leaving Illinois. Not just Right to Work.”
													In a speech to City Council in May, Governor Bruce Rauner said ““For Chicago to get what it wants, Illinois must get what it needs. don’t have the money to simply bail out Chicago. That’s not an option.”</p>

													<p>Marquez thinks this jab was an attack on a hard working labor force and does not agree.
														“Bruce Rauner said he wasn’t going to bail out Chicago. I think that shows how biased and nasty he is anyway. I’ve driven across Illinois. If he doesn’t bail out Chicago, who’s going to vote for him? The corn stalks? I was born and raised here and some of the hardest working people I’ve ever met live here and he has the nerve to blame us. Ok.”</p>

														<p>“The thing about politics is, they use their numbers and their words to manipulate people. And they want to say it’s ok, but we really have to do our research to know what’s real and what’s really going down.”</p>

														<p>“no one WANTS to live in Indiana. There’s way more to it then Right to Work!” he laughs.</p>

														<p>“Nah I’m sure there’s something beautiful there too, but Chicago is my home. It’s just political volleyball Politicians are trying to take it back and forth and Bruce Rauner- I don’t know how he got elected- has decided that now he’s union busting. That’s the bottom line. Because if a union worker decides to not be represented by the union, he’d still get the union’s benefits. How fair is that?”</p>

														<p>Union benefits are healthcare, legal representation, protection from malicious managers, publicity, unification of people, and most famously organization. The contract between Unite Local 1 and Sodexo ends in September. Marquez believes that a storm is brewing between mistreated laborers and Sodexo management.</p>

														<p>“Come September, we will have to fight. That living wage is important. If we don’t get it, I just don’t know…” he trails off and stares into the pond. “It’s all about the money for those who have money. It’s always about some bottom line.”</p>

														<p>In the past, Rafael has also been a part of SEIU (Server’s Employees International Union).</p>  

														<p>“Let me break it down, Right to Work wants to cut down on labor dues. Um Hello? You’re still getting the labor union’s benefits. You have to pay dues no matter where you come from. Right to work is telling workers that you can get the same benefits from the dues that other workers are paying, and not pay anything for it. It’s enticing workers to not even bother joining a union. To be de-unionized. What is our country without unions? Our country was built on unions. This is the UNITED States of America. How can you tell people to separate themselves from what they do in their everyday labor? How can you support telling people to separate themselves from one another knowing that that’s the only way real change happens?  That’s the only way we’ve ever gotten the job done! It’s like- that’s a separation tactic- to break up unity and then allow big business to have its way with lower wage workers.”</p>

														<p>“Unions are the only way for management to really hear workers because we’re just coming from two very different perspectives. It’s hard to hear one lone person making minimum wage when you’re a big business executive.  It’s hard to even understand what they’re talking about from way up there. Unions act as the bridge between people. People without a voice actually gain a voice with a union and they get represented so they can speak out about mistreatment. If a person does not have a voice in the workplace, that’s just corrupt.</p>

														<p>“If unions go down, poverty will go up. That is not a question. Unions bring up wages. Companies bring down wages.”</p>

														<p>“That’s the one thing I love about Chicago; we’re not going down without a fight!"</p>

														<p>Chicago’s public school teachers may soon be taking cues from the past.</p>

														<p>In 2012, Chicago’s public school teachers went on strike in response to a series of procedural changes issued by the city Board of Education, including a longer school day and a teacher evaluation system that prioritized students’ standardized test scores. Three years later, on the verge of their next contract negotiation, the teachers’ union and the board of ed. are once again at an impasse.</p>

														<p>In 2015, the fight is centered on salaries. After refusing to extend their 2012 contract, the city has asked teachers to accept a seven percent pay-cut. For the city, paying teachers more would expand a budget deficit they’re working to close. For the teachers, accepting a reduction in funding would be considered a blow to the members who fought the Board three years ago, plus the union exists specifically to make sure teachers are paid and supported as well as the city will allow. With the June 30 contract negotiation deadline fast approaching, both organizations refuse to back down.</p>

														<p>To Curtis Bynum, an organizer for the CTU, the teacher’s union not only exists to raise awareness of all of the debates surrounding education but also to help teachers like Seavoy who find themselves overworked and overwhelmed.</p>

														<p>“[The] CTU’s position is, look, let’s take this burden off the classroom teacher,” Bynum said. “You get in there and you do your job and do the best you can with what you have and let us fight this battle of getting you a fair and just contract and equity in the system. You should have teachers walking into a professional environment on a daily basis, being respected.”</p>

														<p>Bynum believes their members are prepared to do whatever is necessary to protect all the progress they’ve made in recent years, and said teachers will strike if they are not able to come to a peaceful resolution in time. Because of the already wary relationship between the teacher’s union and the Board, Bynum says members never hesitate to call their representatives or vote in online petitions as issues arise.</p> 

														<p>Three years ago, retired teacher Pat Knazze stood on the picket lines alongside working Chicago teachers. Knazze has been an active member of the CTU since she first started teaching in 1972 and now serves as co-chair of the Retired Teachers Committee. If teachers decide to strike again, she echoes Bynum in saying she would not hesitate to support her “brothers and sisters,” should they choose to walk out.</p>

														<p>“The only thing that a worker has is to withhold your labor,” Knazze said. “That’s all you have. You have to withhold your labor in order for your employer to understand that we need to negotiate in good faith and we can’t balance the budget on our backs.”</p>
														<p>While all teachers feel the tension caused by the strike, some members have concerns over how the strike may affect the classroom. Carrie Seavoy, a first-year teacher at Gwendolyn Brooks Preparatory High School, is fearful for what the strike may mean for her students.</p>

														<p>Strikes require teachers to show up to work but ban them from entering their classrooms, and Seavoy believes this would be detrimental to the students. Yet she acknowledges that, in the long run, much of what union is fighting for reflects changes she desperately wants to see in her own classroom.</p>

														<p>Bynum, who began his teaching career in 2003, explains that teachers now are extremely overworked. Early in his career, he had time to focus on training and research that he could bring into the classroom. Teachers, now bombarded with paperwork and city-mandated procedure, have no time or incentive to cultivate a personalized classroom experience.</p>

														<p>Seavoy attests to this when she described the daily protocol used at her school. Sending an email home to parents commending their student’s hard work or improvement no longer sits at the click of a button. In addition, she has to document the email on two different websites. For the music and theatre teacher to plan her concerts, she’s required to submit details through three separate online approval systems. In order to sell tickets, she has to fill out four sheets of paper.</p>

														<p>“Teaching is truly the busiest job in the world,” she explains. “And being in CPS, there’s just all of this additional paperwork that we have to do on top of everything else. The teaching part will always be great but all of this other stuff is why people don’t want to be teachers anymore.”</p>

														<p>Although she is only in her first year, Seavoy notices the union’s fight and hopes that if a strike is necessary, union members can successfully show the Board that teachers desperately need to see a change. Despite any doubts and fears, she knows that she and her coworkers will go on strike together if the Board and the union don’t reach a peaceful negotiation.</p>

														<p>Seavoy also explains that her class sizes--one already at a whopping 46--are only growing. With her predicted class sizes in for the upcoming school year, Seavoy wonders how effective she’ll be in the classroom.</p>

														<p>Whether there will be a repeat of the 2012 negotiation still remains a question. No matter the outcome, Bynum acknowledges the fact that the fight for Chicago’s teachers is far from over.</p>

														<p>“The bug doesn’t stop there,” he explains. “You have to continue to fight. You’re not going to roll over and say, ‘that’s the end, we’re done.’ Ultimately, you’re going to have some impact in making change and so whatever Rauner and the school board does, you still fight. There may be some untapped glimmer of hope out there and so, we will continue to push on.”</p>

														<p>When Michael Lucci started his job at Santisi’s IGA grocery store in Youngstown, Ohio as a teenager, he didn’t expect that it would send him down a path to search for a solution to a common labor problem across the United States.</p>

														<p>Today, Michael works at the Illinois Policy Institute, a nonprofit that researches and educates on public policy solutions as the director of jobs and growth.</p>

														<p>His experiences have influenced him to believe that a big change for unions is what will give unions the life they need to be functional. Right-To-Work legislation gives people working in traditionally unionized workforces to pay union dues or not for membership.</p>

														<p>As a strong advocate for Right-To-Work, he thinks that the policy will provide opportunity for workers to make a choice about their involvement in unions.</p>

														<p>If anything, Michael believes that the policy strengthens unions and has numbers to back it. In Indiana, where Right-To-Work was enacted in late 2014, union membership and manufacturing jobs increased. In fact, Michael said, Indiana has added over 40,000 manufacturing jobs while Illinois continues to leak their manufacturing jobs.</p> 

														<p>One of the problems though, is that while Indiana has added manufacturing jobs, union workers are still making $54 more a week as of 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

														<p>When Michael was working at Santisi’s, the minimum wage was just above $5.00 an hour. Because Santisi’s has a union contract attached to it, Michael was required to pay union dues to keep his job.</p>

														<p>The union dues cut his paycheck nearly in half. While he wasn’t trying to put food on the table, he knew that this didn’t seem fair.</p>

														<p>It didn’t add up. Why would he unwillingly be paying a group of people an amount of money that seemed beyond unreasonable just to keep his minimum wage job?</p>

														<p>Surely there was a reason for this that he didn’t know or understand, so he asked if he could stop paying his union dues.</p> 

														<p>When he asked the owner of Santisi’s, the owner said, “When I stop paying the union, that’s when you can stop paying the union.”</p>

														<p>Michael understood then that the grocery store had to continually renegotiate the contract in order to keep its employees, but it was draining the company of their money.</p>

														<p>“Unions can force you to pay money for you to just have a job. It’s allowing for individual choice.”</p>

														<p>Michael recalls that when Santisi’s started out in Youngstown, there were probably about 15 stores. When he started working there were only three left. Today, only one remains.</p>

														<p>As a kid, Michael remembers that steel mills used to be one of the largest manufacturers in the city. In 1977, the city, along with other major steel cities such as Pittsburgh were hit hard with Black Monday, when Youngstown Sheet and Tube shut its doors.</p>

														<p>Since Black Monday, Youngstown has lost over half of its population and has struggled to recover.</p>

														<p>“It essentially wiped out the middle class,” said Michael.</p>

														<p>While Illinois hasn’t wiped out the middle class, Michael pointed out that Illinois is having the hardest time recovering from the recession.</p> 

														<p>“What we have in Illinois is a broken status quo,” said Michael. “We have the worst recovery from the recession in the country.”</p>

														<p>In Governor Bruce Rauner’s Turnaround Plan, Right-To-Work zones would be able to give union members the option to be in the unions if they choose, instead of forced union participation like Michael experienced as a teenager.</p>

														<p>“It’s a modernization,” Michael said.</p>

														<p>With Illinois having a bigger employment gap after the recession and a large out-migration, he sees the Turnaround Plan as a thing that will keep Illinois strong.</p>

														<p>For Michael, Right-To-Work and Bruce Rauner’s Turnaround Plan aren’t being put in place to destroy unions, they’re there to make them stronger and give people a voice within their unions.</p>

														<h3 class="subhead">The Bus – 10:45 am</h3>
														<p>Coach bus 010, one of two buses carrying Chicago-area protesters from the city to Oak Brook, Ill., drove towards a sky of stormy weather.</p>

														<p>The buses were arranged by Workers Organizing for Chicago, an advocacy group for fast food workers that runs the Chicago chapter of the “Fight for 15,” a national movement to raise the minimum wage. The protesters knew what they wanted: A base-wage bump for to $15 per hour and the right for McDonald's employees to unionize. In Oak Brook, at McDonald's corporate headquarters, they would stand close enough to the company to make sure someone would listen.</p>

														<p>The 40 or so people on the bus included four organizers, a handful of concerned citizens and pockets of students from labor groups at UIC and Harold Washington College. Though no one fretted over the weather, many came prepared, with raincoats or umbrellas, and backpacks with extra food and water. The group rode in relative quiet, eating their WOCC-provided sandwiches and chatting among themselves on the way to the protest.</p>

														<p>The event would include a half-mile march to the McDonald's corporate campus from a nearby office park. A stage erected on McDonald’s Drive served as the focal point of the protest, allowing speakers to address the crowd, which included Fight for 15 advocates from across the country, as far away as Atlanta and New York.</p>

														<p>The movement had high hopes for this particular protest. Fight for 15 organizers expected more than 5,000 people, making it their largest single-stage gathering to date.</p>

														<p>The sheer numbers, however, did not quite meet their expectations. Police reported that about 2,000 protesters marched that day. Still, the program was massive compared to the group’s protest during the same week last year, where 500 protesters blocked traffic on McDonald's’ campus.</p>

														<p>Since then, the movement had seen some major victories. In December 2014, Chicago’s city council voted to raise the minimum wage from $8.25 to $10 on July 1, 2015, and up to $13 dollars in 2019. Just the day before, the city of Los Angeles voted to raise the city’s minimum wage to $15 by 2020.</p>

														<p>Even McDonald's had capitulated. In April, the company announced plans to raise their starting salary to a dollar over each location’s local minimum wage in stores owned and operated by the company, about 10 percent of its U.S. locations. Most McDonald’s locations are owned by independent franchises.</p>

														<p>Shortly after the bus departed the WOCC offices, Christina Rivero, a union organizer, let everyone know the plan. The group would get off the bus at an office park in Oak Brook where they would gather with the rest of the protesters before the march. Rivero also introduced their chapter’s heavy hitter, Tyree Johnson, 46 year-old man who’s worked at McDonald’s for half of his life and continues to do. As a veteran of 10 strikes, Johnson’s become a de facto poster boy for unionizing fast food workers in Chicago.</p>

														<p>“Instead of McDonald’s investing billions and billions of dollars in shareholders,” Johnson said, “[we hope] they might invest that money into their employees.”</p>

														<p>Johnson tried to drum up enthusiasm from the group, teaching them rallying cries they would use later in English and Spanish:</p>

														<p>“Hold the burgers. Hold the fries. Makes our wages super-sized!”</p>

														<p>“When low-wage workers are under attack? What do we do? Stand up! Fight back!”</p>

														<h3 class="subhead">The Set-up – 11:13 am</h3>
														<p>As everyone got off the bus, they followed the stream of red fight for 15 shirts and black McDonald’s visors around the corner to the small dead-end street that served as the staging point for the march. There, protesters raised signs and unfurled banners. One group brought a giant cardboard paycheck for $206.17, one week’s pay at minimum wage, signed by Ronald McDonald.</p>

														<p>Down the parade line, different calls and responses would drift in and out of earshot every 20 feet or so. “What do we want?,” blared out of a megaphone. “15!,” the crowd responded. “When do we want it?,” he asked, and the crowd cried, “Now!”</p>

														<p>“If we don’t get it?”</p>
														<p>“Shut it down!”</p>
														<p>“If we don’t get it?”</p>
														<p>“Shut it down!”</p>

														<p>The crowd was composed. When protesters were asked keep off the grass in front of the offices along block, they stepped back to the street. During the Fight for 15 protest there last year, more than 130 Fight for Fifteen activists allowed themselves to be arrested for trespassing.</p>

														<p>Hunter Drive was a roughly 450-foot-long road wedged between a few office buildings and 22nd street. A couple of men on the roof of a building overlooking the street watched the spectacle, but very few people other than the organizers seemed concerned with their presence.</p>

														<h3 class="subhead">The March – 11:30 am</h3>

														<p>Once most of the protesters reached their starting positions, the group lurched forward McDonald's headquarters. Police blocked westbound traffic, lining the road with bicycle-bound officers to keep meandering protesters from wandering onto the street or spilling onto pedestrian walkways. The Oak Brook police department gathered 300 officers from 100 agencies across the state to ensure they could cover the whole route for the duration of the protest.</p>

														<p>“Fired up! We can’t it take no more!,” the bellow of the crowd travelled down the march as one group handed off their chant to the next. “We’re fired up! Can’t take it no more!”

															<p>Even when the decibel was high, the pace stayed at a casual stroll. Women pushed strollers. Friends conversed. Some posed for pictures or stretched their phones above the crowd, attempting to capture its size.</p>

															<p>Underneath the call and response, there was also an undercurrent of concern. Many of the protesters didn’t see the news about Los Angeles minimum wage increase as a victory. Some were hopeful that it might start a wider trend, but many lamented that those living in poverty would still have make to it through five more years of anemic wages.</p>

															<p>When the front of the march reached the stage, the program began. Protesters put down their signs. The people were ready to listen.</p>

															<p>One by one, a series of McDonald's workers told the group about their economic struggles. The crowd listened intently, cheering or responding.  Many were unable to support their families: Two women, Kwanza Brooks and Keandra Guilmant, brought their children with them on stage.</p>

															<p>“Every month I try to figure out how to pay my bills,” Guilmant said, holding back tears. “And it’s hard.</p>

															<p>Rodney Williams, chairperson of the NAACP religious affairs committee, and Reverend William Barber II, president of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP, headlined the program.</p>

															<p>The Rev. Barber emphasized the need for fast food workers to unionize.</p>

															<p>“You are not looking for a hand-out. You are fighting for a living wage, and that’s as American as apple pie.”</p>

															<h3 class="subhead">The Bus Home – 2:00 pm</h3>
															<p>After the speeches, the crowd dispersed, retreating to buses parked in along the road and nearby parking lots.</p>

															<p>Back on bus 010, the group was chattier and friendlier, bonded by a day of fighting what they saw as the good fight.</p>

															<p>Rivero told group the agenda for day two: protesters would meet back in Oak Brook at 6am, present a million-signature petition —gathered by Fight for 15 outfits from across the country— to McDonald’s before the shareholders’ meeting, and protest again outside their headquarters. Unlike the first day, however, there would be no ride from downtown. No lunch would be provided.</p>

															<p>Tyree Johnson quickly fell asleep lying across the back row of the bus. Patricia Knazze a retired teacher mentioned that the teachers’ union would be in Springfield tomorrow at their own protest, though she would not be attending it herself. The Harold Washington College students remembered that they were still waiting to get their spring semester grades.</p>

															<p>The response was supportive, but the group had clearly given as much energy as they could muster. The next day would bring a second wave of roughly 1,000 protesters returned to Oak Brook, about half the size of the initial march.</p>

															<p>Every Mayday, Hale Landes communes with his fellow workers Haymarket Square on N. Desplaines St. where Chicago’s labor movement was born. He stood among a small crowd of laborers from various unions and labor rights supporters, holding up a black and red sign, demanding, “Stop the war on workers!”</p>
															<p>“Solidarity forever,” the whole group sang, led by a man with a guitar on the small Mayday rally stage. “For the union makes us strong!”</p>
															<p>Landes thought it was a good day for a rally. Not too hot, not too cold, not too sunny. Whether he’s on the job, or at a rally Landes always wears the same get-up: Blue jeans and a bright orange t-shirt representing his local, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers #134, so there is an ideal weather for it.</p>

															<p>He weaved through the protesters, gathered around the stage, stopping to speak with labor activists he’d met at other rallies or fellow members of the Illinois Labor History Society.

															<p>Every year, the protesters at the Haymarket Mayday rally call for the same thing, the right for laborers across the world to unionize. But in 2015, that demand held special value in Illinois, where a series of attempts to bring right-to-work legislation to the state.</p>

															<p>Governor Bruce Rauner’s “turnaround agenda,” a set of legislative initiative that includes pension and workers compensation reform, as well as a bill allowing government contractors to ignore “prevailing wage” standards set by union contracts, all of which would weaken the organizational strength of unions statewide. Though the governor’s attempts to enact these laws have been rejected by the state supreme court and the Illinois House of Representatives, respectively, rumors of the governor’s next wave of legislation have already begun to spread.</p>

															<p>Characterizing Landes’ position on these issues as the opposite of Rauner’s would not do his perspective justice. He believes in a bottom-up approach to the economy: That any organization or law that puts money in the hands of workers will increase spending and naturally spread the wealth.</p>

															<p>“Mr Rauner’s ‘turnaround agenda’ is a bunch of hooey,” Landes said. “It’s not going to help. Getting rid of the unions won’t help… That’s taking money out of the pockets of the real job creators. The people who are spending their money.”’</p>

															<p>Landes’ career in electrical maintenance has kept an even keel since he joined International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers almost 30 years ago. Landes found his way to the IBEW through a friend already in the union, who hired him as a security technician trainee, which led to him getting a “Class A” electrician permit. His road would have been longer had he came to the union without any connections.</p>

															<p>For nearly two decades, Landes, 54 has kept the lights on and electricity flowing in O’Hare’s parking facilities, on behalf of his employer, the Gim Electric Company, which has a contract with the airport. There’s always going to be an airport and so, presumably, he will continue to have a job so long as his body lets him do it.</p>

															<p>His union cannot claim the same stability. IBEW #134, whose membership includes a large subset of independent electricians working with Chicago contractors, has seen a steady decline in membership and income since 2008. There’s little hope for an influx of new blood: The percentage of Illinois’ unionized jobs hovered around 15 percent from 2004-2014, dipping to its all-time low, 14.5 percent, in 2007. Illinois’ percentage union membership peaked in 1993 at 21 percent.</p>

															<p>Though recent attempts to implement a right-to-work law in Illinois, which would allow workers forego collective bargaining even when employers have a union contract, have been repelled by labor lobbyists and their allies, Landes’ way of life hasn’t been entirely unaffected by the gradual weakening the movement, spurred on by the great recession and immense expansion of the service industry, which is largely de-unionized.</p>

															<p>“I make a good wage,” Landes said. “That being said, my wages have been pretty stagnant. One year we got no raise at all. Another year we got a fifty-cent raise, which doesn’t keep up with inflation.”</p>

															<p>The rate on Landes paycheck will go up from $44 to $45 per hour on June 1, 2015, as his current IBEW contract enters its third year. His new wages also includes an extra $1.25, which will be applied to supporting union benefits, such as insurance and the union’s apprenticeship program. He described the increase as standard.</p>

														</div>


														<div class="col-md-4">
															<p>Landes spent the first 20 years of his career as an active, but not necessarily outspoken, member of the union. That changed when Landes’ first grandson, Gage, was born in 2007. It caused him to reflect on his life and he realized there were forces that might prevent Gage from providing for his family if he were to follow in Landes’ footsteps as a unionized laborer.</p>

															<p>“The reason I became involved is I looked around and I had a fear that he had no future,” Landes said, “through no fault of his own.”</p>

															<p>Landes considers his union as a contributing factor to many of his life’s proudest accomplishments —owning a home, putting his wife through college and nursing school, raising his two children.</p>

															<p>Not only does his union contract maintain Landes wage, but also he receives health insurance, multiple pensions and legal representation for work-related matters. To him, any legislation, including any kind of right-to-work law, is a step towards a world where working Americans will not receive similar compensation.</p>

															<p>“If they [the elite] could get us to work for free, they would.”</p>

															<p>Landes wonders why more workers in non-union sectors don’t feel outraged by the general shift in the American job market away from providing the benefits his union ensures, including retirement benefits, such as a pension.</p>

															<p>“I’m very tired of hearing people say, ‘I don’t get a pension. Why should you?’ That’s the wrong thing to say. The question is, ‘I do get a pension. Why don’t you?’ … I want to spend time with my grandkids. I don’t want to drop dead at work.”</p>

															<p>And Landes would happily help any worker go out and get those benefits. He takes the idea of worker “brotherhood” very seriously. When he sees a fellow union worker on the job, he greets them, “Hey brother” (or “sister”). He goes out of his way to buy products made in American, at union-friendly shops.</p>

															<p>While visiting his stepson and three grandchildren in Kentucky over Memorial Day weekend, Landes heard about a group of United Steelworkers union members who were protesting outside Century Aluminum, a smelting facility in Hawkesville, Kentucky, where contract negotiations prompted the employer to lock the workers out. Landes packed up his stepson and his two grandsons drove 45 minutes to the factory to join them.</p>

															<p>Though Landes said he wouldn’t have driven for many hours or given up the chance to spend time with his grandchildren to support the protest, he said that when he heard about the lockout he felt he “had to go.”</p>

															<p>They didn’t stay long — about 45 minutes, by Landes’ count. It was a Sunday and holiday weekend, so there weren’t many people out, plus the sparsely populated refinery parking lots didn’t make a particularly engaging playground for young boys.</p>

															<p>After they left, Landes’ clan completed their “boys day out” with a trip to Rural King, a farming supply store, and some ice cream. Landes didn’t necessarily think his grandsons got much out of the experience at the picket line, but their presence helped the Steelworkers’ cause all the same.</p>

															<p>“I couldn’t say they enjoyed it, Landes said of their time at the protest. “But as we were driving off, my son asked them, ‘how did they feel making all those people being there?’ And that they liked that. Putting smiles on people’s faces.”</p>
