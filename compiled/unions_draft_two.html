          	<p>EXPLAINER SCRIPT: Illinois is big on labor. Chicago is the City of Big Shoulders. Illinois sits squarely in the Rust Belt, surrounded by neighbors threatening unions. First there was Indiana, then Michigan and finally Wisconsin. Is Illinois next? Governor Bruce Rauner wants it, and his proposition is Right-To-Work, which gives people working in unionized jobs a choice about membership. Some people see this as empowerment for workers and others see it as a threat to unions.</p>

			<p>Since Governor Rauner’s election in January, he has proposed different plans, some of which have been deemed illegal, and legislators on both the left and right have blocked every plan. But Right-To-Work also comes to Illinois with a $6 billion budget deficit and a pension crisis that threatens the retirement of many workers.</p>

			<p>Now workers are worried. This is a union town. Everyone - your cafeteria workers, your teachers, your garbage men, your steel workers, your carpenters, all have a stake in the issue. It’s clear the Governor won’t back down from Right-To-Work, and there are jobs, pensions, benefits — their livelihoods, on the line. So who’s right, in this right, or fight to work?</p>

          <p>Carrie Seavoy is the self-proclaimed “baby” at her school. She first began working as a music and theater teacher at Gwendolyn Brooks College Preparatory Academy last May, and has officially been a member of the Chicago Teacher’s Union since her very first day.</p>

          <p>“At our first meeting of the year--our first ‘in-service’ day--the union rep literally just handed us all of the paperwork and basically said fill all of this out. It was never a choice like, ‘Do you want to join the union?’”</p>

          <p>Curtis Bynum, a CTU Organizer, says that by contract, every public school teacher in the city of Chicago becomes a union member. The union fights to provide teachers with TK TK TK because: more specific quote TK about teachers just wanting to teach but blocked by so management and admin sometimes; lead into problems Carrie has had as she’s been teaching.</p>

          <p>While Carrie says hasn’t been around long enough to see many tangible changes take place in her school, she takes some comfort in knowing that the CTU is fighting on behalf of Chicago Public School teachers, pushing for things she needs like smaller class sizes and less paperwork.</p>

          <p>On days she decides to send evaluations home to her students’ parents, it’s not as simple as sending an email. She also has to fill out several forms on top of that. Planning a concert--something so essential to her role as a music teacher--is no easy feat either.</p>

          <p>“I have to submit the request through four different online approval systems and then fill out four different pieces of paper just to sell tickets,” she explains. “Teaching is great but there are all these silly CPS requirements that I do know the unions are now fighting against.”<p>

            <p>The unions will have to keep fighting to protect their teachers on the eve of a contract negotiation in June. While Carrie explains that normally, a proposal pushing for a three percent wage increase for teachers is renewed every three years without hesitation, this year’s contract negotiation tells a different story. CPS teachers foresee having to strike to combat the Board of Education’s new proposal--a 7 percent pay cut for Chicago teachers.</p>

            <p>Curtis is certain that teachers in the CTU will be prepared and willing to strike when the time comes. (Quote and bit about how most teachers generally feel about this strike--why they would strike, what they’ve worked so hard to gain in audio TK) </p>

            <p>While Carrie is also upset about the decrease, she doubts the benefits of a union-wide strike.</p>

            <p>“What’s worse for kids--having their teachers be paid a little less money or not being able to go to school for weeks on end because their teachers are walking around with picket signs?” she explains. “If at the end of the day we’re all ‘there for the kids,’ I’m just not sure that striking will accomplish anything.”</p>

            <p>(Some sort of transition here...Curtis explains what the strike will accomplish, gives a bit of background on unions and what they’ve gained so far. Why they should strike--what is at stake that Carrie perhaps doesn’t see yet because she is such a young teacher? TK Carrie and Curtis both brought up previous teachers’ strike in Chicago so doing research on that for more background/exposition)</p>

            <p>Carrie admits that as the “baby” she just doesn’t know enough and younger teachers really see it all as an added hassle. TK--Carrie explains teacher burnout rate, why teachers in Chicago leave so quickly (50% within the first 5 years of teaching), transition into Curtis explaining how unions are working to resolve issues that remain, letting the teachers just teach (nice quote about that would go here to close perhaps).</p>

            <center><p class="lead">Font needs to be smaller. Move the dek closer to the hed. This is the dek for profile three. It will be great. This is the dek for profile 3.</p></center>

          <div class="col-md-3"></div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>When Michael Lucci started his job at Santisi’s IGA grocery store in Youngstown, Ohio as a teenager, he didn’t expect that it would send him down a path to search for a solution to a common labor problem across the United States.</p>

            <p>Today, Michael works at the Illinois Policy Institute, a nonprofit that researches and educates on public policy solutions as the director of jobs and growth. </p>

            <p>His experiences have brought him to a place where he believes that a big change for unions is what will give unions the life they need to be functional. Right-To-Work legislation gives people working in traditionally unionized workforces to pay union dues or not for membership.</p>

            <p>As a strong advocate for Right-To-Work, he believes that the policy will provide opportunity for workers to make a choice about their involvement in unions.</p>

            <p>If anything, Michael believes that the policy strengthens unions and has numbers to back it. In Indiana, where Right-To-Work was enacted in late 2014, union membership and manufacturing jobs increased. In fact, Michael said, Indiana has added over 40,000 manufacturing jobs while Illinois continues to leak their manufacturing jobs.</p>

            <p>One of the problems though, is that while Indiana has added manufacturing jobs, union workers are still making $54 more a week as of 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

            <p>When Michael was working at Santisi’s, the minimum wage was just above $5.00 an hour. Because Santisi’s has a union contract attached to it, Michael was required to pay union dues to keep his job.</p>

            <p>“I’ll never forget that number. $2.15CQ.” It brought his paycheck down by nearly half. While he wasn’t trying to put food on the table, he knew that this didn’t seem fair.</p>

            <p>It didn’t add up. Why would he unwillingly be paying a group of people an amount of money that seemed beyond unreasonable just to keep his minimum wage job?</p>

            </div>
            <p>Surely there was a reason for this that he didn’t know or understand, so he asked if he could stop paying his union dues.</p>

            <p>When he asked the owner of Santisi’s he said, “When I stop paying the union, that’s when you can stop paying the union.”</p> 

            <p>Michael then understood that the grocery store had to continually renegotiate the contract in order to keep its employees, but it was draining the company of their money.</p>

            <p>He knew he didn’t fully understand all of the politics then, but looking back he understands how Right-To-Work could have helped him at Santisi’s.</p>

            <p>“Unions can force you to pay money for you to just have a job. It’s allowing for individual choice.”</p>

            <p>Michael recalls that when Santisi’s started out in Youngstown, there were probably about 15 stores. When he started working there were only three left. Today, only one remains. </p>

            <p>As a kid, Michael remembers that steel mills used to be one of the largest manufacturers in the city. In 1977, the city, along with other major steel cities such as Pittsburgh were hit hard with Black Monday, when Youngstown Sheet and Tube shut its doors.</p>

            <p>Since Black Monday, Youngstown has lost over half of its population and has struggled to recover.</p>

            <p>“It essentially wiped out the middle class,” said Michael.</p>

            <p>While what Illinois has isn’t nearly as drastic as wiping out the middle class, Michael points out that Illinois is having the hardest time recovering from the recession. </p>

            <p>“What we have in Illinois is a broken status quo,” said Michael. “We have the worst recovery from the recession in the country.”</p>

            <p>In Governor Bruce Rauner’s Turnaround Plan, Right-To-Work zones would be able to give union members the option to be in the unions if they choose, instead of a forced union like Michael experienced as a teenager.</p> 

            <p>“It’s a modernization,” Michael said.</p>

            <p>It also includes pension reform and… which are often looked over.</p>

            <p>With Illinois having a bigger employment gap after the recession and a large out-migration, he sees the Turnaround Plan as a thing that will keep Illinois strong.</p>

            <p>For Michael, Right-To-Work and Bruce Rauner’s Turnaround Plan aren’t being put in place to destroy unions, they’re there to make them stronger and give people a voice within their unions. </p>

            <p>Landes considers himself to be a lucky man. Landes career in electrical maintenance has kept an even keel since he joined International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers almost 30 years ago.</p>
 
            <p>For nearly two decades, Landes has kept the lights on and electricity flowing in O’Hare’s parking facilities, on behalf of his employer, the Gim Electric Company, which has a contract with the airport. There’s always going to be an airport and so, presumably, Landes will continue to have a job so long as his body lets him do it.</p>
 
            <p>Not everyone is Landes’ chapter, The International Brotherhood of Electricians local 134, has been so lucky. Both membership and income have steadily declined since 2008. The local, which includes a large subset of independent electricians working with Chicago contractors, reflects the general decline of unionized employees in Illinois, which hit an all-time low at 15 percent in 2014.</p>
 
            <p>Generally speaking, job security and financial stability do not inspire people to action. Hale spent the first 20 years of his career with his head down; active, but not necessarily outspoken. In that time, he managed to provide and elevate his family: He paid his mortgage. He put his wife through college and nursing school. He raised two children, who now have children of their own.</p>
 
            <p>Landes attributes those accomplishments on the support of the IBEW. Not only does the union contract maintain Landes wage, but he receives health insurance, multiple pensions and legal representation for work-related matters. After meeting his first grandson, Gage, in 2007, Landes counted his blessings and realized that there were forces that might impede on the opportunities he’s provided his family might not be readily available when Gage enters the workforce.</p>
 
            <p>“The reason I became involved is I looked around and I had a fear that he had no future,” Landes said, “through no fault of his own.”</p>
 
            <p>To protect the secret to his personal success, Landes started speaking out more at union meetings, looking for like-minded labor activists outside of his group and representing the concerns of a unionized worker at community meetings in Chicago and its northern and western suburbs.</p>
 
            <p>Eight years later, Landes spent a surprisingly hot Mayday afternoon carrying a sign lending his body and voice to a rally against the general threat of Right-To-Work legislation, a priority for Governor Bruce Rauner.</p>
 
            <p>Whether he’s on the job, at a rally or attending lecture related to his activist interests, you can always pick Landes out of a crowd. He always wears the same get-up: Blue jeans and a bright orange IBEW t-shirt. If you somehow weren’t sure it was him, just check for his glasses, on which he’s affixed clear plastic to either side of the frames to protect his eyes. (CQ protective element)</p>
 
            <p>Since the Mayday rally, Rauner’s first right-to-work bill was sent to and summarily rejected by the Illinois House of Representatives, receiving zero votes. TK: Landes response to 5.14 state congress vote that repelled “right to work.”</p>
 
            <p>Rauner’s “turnaround agenda,” a set of legislative initiative that includes pension and workers compensation reform, as well as a bill allowing government contractors to ignore “prevailing wage” standards set by unions CQ, all of which would weaken the organizational strength of unions statewide. Though the governor’s attempts to enact these laws have been rejected by the state supreme court and the Illinois House of Representatives, rumors of the governor’s next wave of legislation have already begun to spread.</p>
 
            <p>Characterizing Landes’ position on these issues as the opposite of Rauner’s would not do his perspective justice. He believes in a bottom-up approach to the economy: That any organization or law that puts money in the hands of workers will increase spending and put more money in more pockets.</p>
 
            <p>“Mr Rauner’s ‘turnaround agenda’ is a bunch of hooey,” Landes said. “It’s not going to help. Getting rid of the unions won’t help… That’s taking money out of the pockets of the real job creators. The people who are spending their money.”’</p>
 
            <p>According to Stephanie Seawell, executive director of the Illinois Labor History Society, there is a correlation between strong union representation higher wages across for both unionized and un-unionized workers in that line of work. “A rising tide lifts all boats,” Seawell said.</p>
 
            <p>Though recent attempts at labor reform been repelled by labor lobbyists and their allies, Landes way of life hasn’t been entirely unaffected by the gradual weakening the movement, spurred on by the great recession and immense expansion of the service industry, which is largely de-unionized.</p>
 
            <p>“I make a good wage,” Landes said. “That being said, my wages have been pretty stagnant. One year we got no raise at all. Another year we got a fifty-cent raise, which doesn’t keep up with inflation.”</p>

          <p>Landes refers to himself as a “social justice” activist, but his work on the two issues he speaks about most frequently, Labor legislation and single-payer health care, inherently tie back to his union affiliation and his personal experience. Aside from acting as a key point of contention between unions and employers, the price of medical care, in Landes’ mind, makes retirement an incredibly difficult proposition for most Americans, including he and his wife.</p>
 
          <p>On a Wednesday afternoon in May, Landes leaned forward to study charts beaming down from a projector in a dim lecture hall at the Chicago College of Orthopedic Medicine in Downer’s Grove, Ill.</p>
 
          <p>The lecture, titled “How Single Payer Mitigates Racial Disparities in Healthcare,” was packaged to persuade medical students at the Chicago College of Orthopedic Medicine, to actively support single-payer health care reform that would expand Medicare into a federally subsidized healthcare system similar to Canada’s.</p>
 
          <p>Landes didn’t attend the lecture because he needed convincing: He needed ammunition. Landes plans to run for a position representing his local at the national IBEW conference at the next union election in 2016. (CQ year) Landes ran to be the alternate for the delegate TK years ago, but didn’t get the job.</p>
 
          <p>When a slide declared “Administration Consumes 31 Percent of every Dollar Spent on Healthcare,” Landes quickly picked his smartphone, unholstered and resting on his thigh, and took a picture.</p>
 
          <p>He planned to take his new statistics to the next meeting of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and will motivate his local to officially support legislation and candidates in favor of such reform. Landes has brought the issue to his union brothers and sisters before but has not been able to change enough minds yet.</p>
